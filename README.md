# C Compiler projet

This is a personnal challenge. I want to create a basic compiler that compile a subset of the C Language. This is not a project to do a serious compiler.  
I use antlr4 to generate the grammar for my compiler.  

## Run

I use a docker image to compile and run the project.  
There is two sh scripts to start and stop the container needed for this project.  
Once launch, go in the source directory and make the project.  
You can then run the tests in the tests directory.
